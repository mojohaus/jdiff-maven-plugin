JDiff Maven Plugin

  Use this plugin to compare two version of projects based on their sources.
  
  "JDiff is a Javadoc doclet which generates an HTML report of all the packages, classes, constructors, methods, and fields which have been removed, added or changed in any way, including their documentation, when two APIs are compared.
  This is very useful for describing exactly what has changed between two releases of a product.
  Only the API (Application Programming Interface) of each version is compared. It does not compare what the source code does when executed."\
